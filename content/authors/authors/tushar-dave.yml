bio: 'I''m a Android Developer, Productivity Geek and a CS Undergrad.

I am a strong believer in the fact that we learn by sharing. I am always eager to share what I have learnt and how did I, to all those who are seeking to know. I always enjoy the interaction with students, clearing their doubts and try to learn from them as well.
