During the Silicon Valley trip, one of the major learning I got was the power of community. I remember myself telling my college senior Kuldeep Srivastav while departing from hotel in Silicon Valley, to develop a strong programming club in our college. Because the only thing that moved me was peer to peer learning and I was fully fascinated about the culture I saw at 42 Silicon Valley. That was the day when I decided to build the same kind of community in our college.

I was in the initial days of the second year of my engineering, having zero experience in running a club. I tried many ways but I was unable to gather support from my fellow mates except some.

Coming from a college where student clubs were running just for the sake of the name, without any guidelines and structure, it was difficult for me to start doing something which will contribute to the community building. I wasted lots of time doing the same kind of activities that other clubs were doing, which didn’t produce the results that I wanted.

But I was very clear about one thing that if I could make a community where students are trying to learn and grow together, then one day will come that students from our college will achieve unexpected things in their lives.

I started brainstorming to find out what should I do so that the club can be more functional and active.

And as they say “ where there is a need there is a way”. I contacted programming club of IIT Roorkee to understand their structure of functioning and kind of activities they do. Fortunately, I got a response. They helped me with everything I was looking for. That was the first time when I started forming a structure for the club.

I finally came with a plan to activate the club of our college. I tried my best and started implementing it. Through some selection processes, our club got the first set of full-time members of the club.

Currently, we are in the process to make our programming club more active and functional. We started our journey with 7 different teams, who are working on various projects of android and web. They are learning lots of things together. Just have a look at it —

I believe community is the real power. It did not just push you to do amazing things it also helps us in our tough times. When you need support, you are surrounded by people who can help you. Clubs and communities are the best places to learn life skills. Developing such a club is our ultimate aim, where we can help many of the students around to explore their full potential.

I believe if the club continues growing like my fellow juniors are working, one day will come when our college will be identified with the reputation of our club.
